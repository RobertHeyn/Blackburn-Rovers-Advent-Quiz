# Blackburn-Rovers-Advent-Quiz

I created a simple python quiz that gives the player the shirt number of former Blackburn Rovers footballers
and the years that they sported that number. The player gets 5 attempts to guess the footballer's last name.
If they get all 5 wrong then the quiz moves on after telling them the name of the footballer. If the player 
gets the answer correct then they get a point which is totalled at the end of the quiz and the player is given
his score as a number out of 31 and as a percentage.
